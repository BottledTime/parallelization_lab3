To compile our code, you can simply used the supplied Makefile by typing:
make

This will compile our Gauss-Jordan elimination implementation. If you would like
to compile this yourself without the Makefile, you can do as follows:
gcc -o main omp_GaussJordanStatic.c Lab3IO.c -g -Wall -fopenmp

This program is called with 1 commandline argument. It is the
number of threads for the program to use.
